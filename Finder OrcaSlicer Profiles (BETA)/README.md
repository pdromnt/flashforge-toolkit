These profiles are still **UNDER TESTING**. Only use them if you know what you are doing and is willing to risk your printer!

Currently the retraction distance is set for an **all-metal** extruder! If you're still using a PTFE tube in the extruder, you should adjust the retraction distance to 1.3mm.

The profiles are based on the **FlashForge Guider 2s** (hence why it shows up as Guider in some places) and **can only be used with the Flashforge Finder 1 and 2**.
