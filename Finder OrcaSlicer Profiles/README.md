These profiles are **ONLY** for the **Flashforge Finder v1/v2**. If your printer is one of the other legacy printers, please create your own profile based on the closest one available, for the Finder, the closest one was the Guider 2s.  
  
#### There's two profiles available:  
- **All-Metal Hotend**: To be used with Finders that have been modified with an all-metal heatbreak and compatible 0.4mm nozzle, hence the retraction distance in the Filament settings is set to 0.5 (temperature is up to whatever your PLA is best with).
- **PTFE Hotend**: For the stock Finder heatbreak + nozzle combo. If your printer hasn't been modified, just use this version of the profile.
  
The profiles are based on the **Flashforge Guider 2s** (hence why it shows up as the Guider in the quality settings) and **can only be used with the Flashforge Finder 1 and 2**. No issues have been found in testing. All needed start and end g-code was extracted from GX files generated by Flashprint and placed accordigly in Orca, same for other settings like bed size and origin point.

In the printer settings inside Orca, you can set the bed model and texture so it shows as a simulation of the actual bed on the Finder.
